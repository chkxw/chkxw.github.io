## Research Interests

I am interested in **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** applied to robotics, with a particular focus on **memory mechanisms in MARL**.
## Current Research

I am currently a visiting student at UMass Amherst working with [Professor Hao Zhang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzhang/), where I focus on developing MARL algorithms for robotic systems.

## Publications

**Reinforcement Learning Within the Classical Robotics Stack: A Case Study in Robot Soccer**

## Research Experience

### Multi-Agent RL for Robotics @ UMass Amherst (2025 - Present)
Working with Professor Hao Zhang on developing MARL algorithms with memory mechanisms for robotic systems.

### Robot Soccer & Sim2Real @ UW-Madison (2023 - 2025)
- **RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Champion**: Developed RL policies with multiple sub-policies for robot soccer, implemented imitation learning algorithms (DAgger, BCO, GAIL), and built multi-agent training environments
- **Abstract Sim2Real Research**: Designed latent space alignment for sim-to-real transfer, implemented robot-side data collection, and trained PPO policies for navigation tasks

### RL for Combinatorial Optimization @ SJTU (2022)
Applied DQN to accelerate solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, with focus on reward tuning and replay buffer optimization.
